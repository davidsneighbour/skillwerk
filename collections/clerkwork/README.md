## AI skills for software engineering workflows

Clerkwork is a collection of reusable AI skills reflecting Patrick's engineering knowledge: dependency maintenance, GitHub issue triage, project tracking, and repository upkeep. The goal is to keep the routine parts of maintaining a repository consistent and portable across projects and AI assistants.

> Clerkwork is the collection. Foreman is its interface. Skills describe jobs. Categories organise the collection.

## Install

Install the current Clerkwork skill set with:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/davidsneighbour/skillwerk/tree/main/collections/clerkwork/skills --yes
```

## Update

Re-run the install command to refresh an existing install:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/davidsneighbour/skillwerk/tree/main/collections/clerkwork/skills --yes
```

Use `--global` when the skills should be available outside the current project.

## Skills

Use `/foreman overview` when you do not remember a skill name. Foreman lists the complete collection by category and can narrow it with requests such as `/foreman git`, `/foreman project`, or route concrete jobs such as `/foreman audit packages`.

Skill names are intentionally flat. Categories organise the collection without becoming part of the invocation name, so individual skills remain independently installable and portable.

### Agent management

* `agent-align` creates or repairs the repository agent entry-point setup.
* `agent-instructions-audit` audits and optimises agent instruction architecture and context cost.

### Repository maintenance

* `dependency-maintenance` safely maintains npm dependencies in a single-package repository or npm monorepo.
* `manage-node-version-policy` audits and updates Node.js and npm version declarations against actively supported releases.
* `osv-scan` scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities, auto-applies safe fixes, and files issues for the rest.

### Project management

* `project-state-report` reports what changed in a repository since a given time, including GitHub PR and issue activity.
* `project-task-triage` syncs the local TODO.md scratch pad with GitHub Issues and regenerates the local PROJECT.md dashboard.
* `resume-interrupted-work` manages a project-root RESUME.md handoff file that blocks new work until interrupted work is resolved.

### Git and GitHub

* `commit` writes Git commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits specification.
* `issues` inspects, selects, and works through project issues using Patrick's GitHub-first workflow, while preserving the same principles on other issue systems where practical.
* `labels` analyses issue text and selects or applies labels from Patrick's category:value label taxonomy.
